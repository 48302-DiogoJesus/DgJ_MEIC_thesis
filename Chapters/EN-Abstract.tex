\noindent Serverless computing has become a suitable cloud paradigm for many applications, prized for its operational ease, automatic scalability, and fine-grained pay-per-use pricing model. However, executing workflows, which are compositions of multiple tasks, in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) environments remains inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the stateless nature of functions, and a heavy reliance on external services for intermediate data transfers and inter-function communication.

In this document, we introduce a decentralized DAG engine that leverages historical metadata to plan and influence task scheduling. Our solution encompasses metadata management, static workflow planning, and a worker-level scheduling strategy designed to drive workflow execution with minimal synchronization. We compare our scheduling approach against WUKONG, another decentralized serverless DAG engine. Our evaluation demonstrates that utilizing historical information significantly improves performance and reduces resource utilization for workflows running on serverless platforms.
