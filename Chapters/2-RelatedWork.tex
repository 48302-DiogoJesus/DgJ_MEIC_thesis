In this section, we explore the serverless computing landscape, starting by exposing the architecture of a typical serverless computing platform, referencing the use cases for this new cloud computing model, and presenting both commercial and open-source offerings. We also delve into workflows, showing how they can be represented, how they are run and managed, and contrasting traditional frameworks for workflow management with more recent solutions that explore cloud technologies, including serverless. Then, we write about three extension proposals to the current serverless platforms design, aiming to improve data locality. We finish this section by presenting relevant workflow orchestrators and schedulers (serverful, serverless, and hybrid) for executing tasks, highlighting their advantages but also some of their limitations and inefficiencies.

\section{Serverless Computing}

Traditionally, cloud applications have been deployed on virtual machines, such as Amazon EC2~\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/pt/ec2/}}, which provide full control over the operating system and runtime environment. This model allows predictable performance, flexible resource allocation, direct communication via local network interfaces between VMs, and the ability to run long-lived services, but it comes with significant operational overhead: developers must manage provisioning (which can take several minutes), scaling, patching, and fault tolerance. 

Serverless computing addresses these challenges by abstracting away infrastructure management, enabling developers to focus solely on application logic. At the storage and database layer, serverless databases and object stores automatically scale with demand and charge based on actual usage. At the application level, \textbf{Backend-as-a-Service} (BaaS) platforms offer ready-to-use components like authentication and messaging. Finally, at the compute layer, \textbf{Function-as-a-Service} (FaaS) provides the most flexible and fine-grained model, allowing developers to deploy individual functions that execute on demand in response to events. In this document, we focus specifically on FaaS, as it is the model most relevant to our work.

The Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model is now offered by major cloud providers, including Amazon (Lambda\cite{aws_lambda}), Google (Cloud Run Functions\cite{google_cloud_run_functions}), Microsoft (Azure Functions\cite{azure_functions}), and Cloudflare (Workers~\cite{cloudflare_workers}). In addition to these commercial offerings, several open-source runtimes such as OpenWhisk\cite{open_whisk}, OpenFaaS\cite{openfaas}, and Knative\cite{knative} provide developers with alternatives for deploying FaaS in self-managed or hybrid environments.

\subsection{Advantages}
Recent industry reports~\footnote{\url{https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/serverless-computing-market-report}} show that serverless computing has seen rapid adoption over the last few years. For example, in 2024 the global serverless computing market was estimated at USD 24.51 billion, and it is projected to more than double to USD 52.13 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 14.1\%. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) constitutes the majority service model, representing over 60\% of serverless market share in 2024. This rapid growth highlights the increasing appeal of serverless architectures, which can be attributed to the following key benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Operational Simplicity} means that developers are abstracted away from the underlying infrastructure management, without worrying about server maintenance, scaling, or provisioning. This enables faster development and deployment cycles;}
    \item{\textbf{Scalability} means the FaaS runtime handles increasing workloads by automatically provisioning additional computational capacity as demand grows, ensuring that applications remain responsive and performant. This makes the FaaS model ideal for applications with \textit{highly variable} or \textit{unpredictable} usage patterns, where we don't know \textit{how many} or \textit{when} requests will arrive;}
    \item{\textbf{Pay-per-use}: FaaS provides a pricing model where users are only charged for the resources used during the actual execution time over the memory used by their functions, rather than for pre-allocated resources (as in Infrastructure-as-a-Service).}
\end{itemize}

Given these advantages, the serverless model is particularly attractive for applications with \textit{highly variable} or \textit{unpredictable} workloads, such as web services, event-driven pipelines, and real-time data processing. It also suits applications that benefit from rapid iteration and deployment, including microservices, and APIs, where minimizing operational overhead is crucial. Furthermore, serverless can be advantageous in cost-sensitive contexts, where pay-per-use pricing reduces expenses for workloads that do not require continuous execution.

These benefits make serverless computing attractive not only for simple, event-driven applications but also for more complex workflows. Serverless workflows are a composition of multiple computational tasks that are chained together to execute applications by orchestrating individual serverless functions into a coordinated sequence. Some workflows have been successfully experimented with on FaaS. Notable examples include ExCamera~\cite{excamera}, a highly parallel video encoding system; Montage~\cite{montage_astronomy}, an astronomical image mosaic generator; and CyberShake~\cite{cybershake_workflow}, a seismic hazard modeling framework.

\subsection{Limitations}
% limitations and when do they show (for which type of apps)
While these advantages make serverless computing highly appealing for a wide range of applications, the model is not without its limitations. As adoption has grown, both practitioners and researchers have identified several technical and architectural challenges that hinder its broader applicability and performance. A number of studies have systematically analyzed these issues, among which Li et al.~\cite{serverless_computing_survey_rw1} provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits, challenges, and open research opportunities in the serverless landscape. The challenges mentioned include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Startup Latencies}: It's the time it takes for a function to start executing user code. Cold starts (explained further) can be critical, especially for functions with short execution times;
    \item \textbf{Isolation}: In serverless, multiple users share the same computational resources (often the same Kernel). This makes it crucial to properly isolate execution environments of multiple users;
    \item \textbf{Scheduling Policies}: Traditional cloud computing policies were not designed to operate in dynamic and ephemeral environments, such as FaaS's;
    \item \textbf{Resource Management}: Particularly storage and networking, needs to be optimized (by service providers) to handle the low latency and scalability requirements of serverless computing. The lack of direct inter-function networking is an example of a limitation that narrows down the variety of applications that can currently run on FaaS, as some may not support the overhead of using intermediaries (external storage) for data exchange;
    \item \textbf{Fault-Tolerance}: Cloud platforms impose restrictions on developers by encouraging the development of \textit{idempotent functions}. This makes it easier for providers to implement fault-tolerance by retrying failed function executions.
\end{itemize}

Hellerstein et al. \cite{serverless_computing_drawbacks_survey_rw1} portrays FaaS as a \textit{"Data-Shipping Architecture"}, where data is intensively moved to code, through external storage services like databases, bucket storage or queues, to circumvent the limitation of inter-function direct communication. This can greatly degrade performance, while also incurring extra costs.

These limitations notably impact workflowsâ€”complex applications composed of multiple functions orchestrated into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each function's output serves as input for subsequent functions. Such workflows are prevalent in scientific computing, data processing, and machine learning pipelines. 

\subsection{Research Efforts}

To overcome some of the inherent limitations of traditional Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms, several research initiatives have proposed architectural innovations aimed at improving performance, scalability, and orchestration. Apache OpenWhisk~\cite{open_whisk} adopts a fully event-driven, trigger-based architecture, in which functions are invoked automatically in response to events, allowing for more responsive execution and efficient resource utilization. Its design supports complex workflows and fine-grained control over function composition, making it suitable for latency-sensitive and distributed applications. 

Building on similar principles, TriggerFlow~\cite{triggerflow} extends the trigger-based approach by implementing an \textit{event-condition-action} paradigm, enabling efficient orchestration of complex workflows such as state machines and DAGs. This allows high-volume event processing, dynamic scaling, and improved fault tolerance, making it well-suited for long-running scientific and data-intensive workflows. 

Another notable platform, OpenFaaS~\cite{openfaas}, fights \textit{vendor lock-in} by emphasizing simplicity and portability, allowing developers to deploy serverless functions on a wide range of infrastructures while maintaining an event-driven execution model. Collectively, these platforms show how architectural innovationsâ€”particularly in event handling and workflow orchestrationâ€”can mitigate many of the performance and scalability limitations found in conventional FaaS systems.

%%%%%%
While solutions such as OpenWhisk and TriggerFlow propose completely novel serverless architectures, others such as Palette Load Balancing~\cite{palette_load_balancing}, Faa\$T~\cite{faast_caching}, Pocket~\cite{pocket}, Pheromone~\cite{pheromone}, and Lambdata~\cite{lambdata_intents} propose extending either the FaaS runtime or the workflow definition language to address one of the most pressing limitation of the serverless paradigm: data management inefficiencies.

Palette~\cite{palette_load_balancing} is a FaaS runtime extension that improves data locality by introducing the concept of \textbf{``colors``} as \textit{locality hints}. These colors are parameters attached to function invocations, enabling the invoker to express the desired affinity between invocations without directly managing instances. Palette then uses these hints to route invocations with the same color to the same instance \textit{if possible}, allowing for data produced by one invocation to be readily available to subsequent invocations, reducing the need for expensive data transfers, as it would be required in a typical FaaS runtime. This extra control that Palette provides can be used by workflow schedulers, which have insights on the data dependencies between tasks, to try co-locating tasks which share data dependencies, for example, leading to greater performance while also reducing resource utilization.

Faa\$T (Function-as-a-Service Transparent Auto-scaling Cache)~\cite{faast_caching} tackles the same issue as Palette, locality, but does so on the data level, by adding a \textbf{transparent caching layer} into the FaaS runtime. Each application is assigned an in-memory \textit{cachelet} that stores frequently accessed data, enabling subsequent invocations to reuse it without resorting to remote storage. Cachelets cooperate as a distributed cache using \textit{consistent hashing} to share objects across instances, while pre-warming and auto-scaling mechanisms adapt the cache to workload demands. Unlike Palette, which requires user-provided hints, Faa\$T operates automatically, preserving the simplicity of the serverless model, hence the "transparent" in its name.

Similarly, Lambdata~\cite{lambdata_intents} improves data locality by relying on explicit \textbf{data intents} provided by the developer. Functions declare which objects they will read and write, allowing the controller to co-locate invocations that share data dependencies on the same worker and reuse a local cache. This reduces remote storage accesses and data transfer overheads. Compared to Palette's flexible color hints, Lambdata's data intents are more precise but place stricter requirements on developers, while contrasting with Faa\$T's fully automated and distributed approach. Contrasting with Palette, Lambdata requires less effort from the developer, but at the cost of reduced flexibility.

\section{Workflows}
%TODO: Intro
As stated before, workflows represent systematic methodologies for organizing and executing computational processes, providing a structured approach to designing, managing, and reproducing generic computations. Workflows have proven to be useful for many different use cases, from application payments and order processing, to data analytics pipelines that move and transform large datasets, to scientific computing and simulations where complex experiments are broken into manageable steps. 

\subsection{Workflow Definition Languages}
% workflow definition languages (see pic.pdf)
At their conceptual core, most workflows can be represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which model computational processes by depicting tasks as nodes and their dependencies as edges connecting them. As an example of a typical web application workflow, consider an online payment process. When a user makes a purchase, the workflow can be represented as a DAG, where each task corresponds to a step in the transaction process. The first task may involve verifying the user's credentials, followed by tasks such as checking product availability, processing payment, and confirming the order. Each of these tasks \textit{depends on} the successful completion of the previous step, with dependencies that ensure the correct order of operations. For instance, payment processing cannot proceed without confirming the product availability, and order confirmation only occurs once payment has been processed. This simple DAG structure ensures that each task is executed in sequence, while also \textit{enabling parallel execution} where possible, such as checking product availability and verifying payment simultaneously.

Despite the existence of other ways to express workflows, due to the simplicity of writing and interpreting DAGs, most systems and libraries use this representation. For instance, Apache Airflow\cite{apache_airflow} uses DAGs to define and schedule workflows defined in Python. Similarly, Dask\cite{dask_python}, a Python parallel computing library, also utilizes DAGs to represent task dependencies, enabling the parallel execution of tasks across clusters. DAGMan (Directed Acyclic Graph Manager)\cite{dagman} is a way HTCondor\cite{htcondor} (distributed computing job manager) users can organize independent jobs into workflows, also in the form of DAGs.

However, there are more flexible alternatives to define workflows. YAWL (Yet Another Workflow Language)\cite{yawl} is a \textit{workflow language} that provides a highly expressive framework for workflow management, capable of supporting a wider range of workflow patterns. YAWL uses Petri networks\cite{petri_nets} instead of DAGs to model workflows. This allows YAWL to handle more complex control-flow structures, such as loops, parallelism, and advanced synchronization patterns, offering greater flexibility and power in defining and managing intricate workflows.

While using more capable and flexible workflow languages, such as \textit{YAWL} (Yet Another Workflow Language) allows the representation of more complex workflow patterns, most of the tools used for defining and running scientific workflows, like \textit{Apache Airflow}, \textit{Dask}, and HTCondor's DAGMan use the Directed Acyclic Graph format. This is because DAGs effectively model the majority of scientific workflows, which typically involve non-cyclic dependencies, making them simpler to compose, deploy, understand, debug, and visualize.

\subsection{Traditional Workflow Scheduling}
Going from a workflow definition to actual execution involves several key stages: provisioning resources to match computational demands, uploading code, dependencies, and data to ensure a consistent execution environment, scheduling tasks efficiently to optimize cost and performance, monitoring execution for performance and fault detection, and finally deprovisioning resources once the workflow completes. Traditional scheduling approaches from Grid and Cloud computing assume centralized control, which does not fully align with the ephemeral, stateless nature of serverless computing. Serverless platforms, however, can simplify many of these stages by automating resource scaling, data staging, fault handling, monitoring, and teardown, reducing operational overhead while adapting execution to dynamic workloads.

To alleviate some of the developers and researchers' pain points during these steps while scheduling workflows on more traditional \textit{Infrastructure as a Service} (IaaS) platforms, several data processing and workflow scheduling frameworks have emerged. Among the platforms for \textbf{data processing pipelines} are Apache Spark\cite{apache_spark}, Apache Flink\cite{apache_flink}, and Apache Hadoop\cite{apache_hadoop}, which focus on processing and analyzing large datasets efficiently through parallel and distributed computing. On the \textbf{workflow scheduling and orchestration} side, traditional platforms include Apache Oozie\cite{apache_oozie} and HTCondor\cite{htcondor}, which manage the execution and coordination of complex sequences of tasks, ensuring that dependencies are handled and resources are allocated effectively. These frameworks help streamline both the data processing and the management of workflows.

Apache Hadoop provided a foundation for large-scale data processing when it introduced the MapReduce~\cite{mapreduce} paradigm, supported by HDFS and YARN~\cite{yarn} for reliable storage and resource management. Apache Spark provides a flexible distributed model with rich libraries for analytics and efficient task dependency management, while Apache Flink specializes in real-time stream processing with low latency and robust state handling. In terms of workflow orchestration, Apache Oozie specializes in coordinating Hadoop-based tasks, whereas HTCondor targets high-throughput scientific workflows, efficiently managing complex dependencies. 

Similarly, Dask~\cite{dask_python} and its distributed scheduler (Dask Distributed~\cite{dask_python_distributed}) extend the familiar Python ecosystem to large-scale data and compute workloads, enabling parallel execution of array, dataframe, and machine learning operations across clusters, with a lightweight task graph scheduler that supports both batch and interactive computation. Together, these frameworks illustrate the range of solutions available for executing and coordinating workflows on top of the IaaS model, spanning batch and streaming data as well as data-centric and scientific computing environments.

While these frameworks address many critical aspects of resource provisioning, code and dependency management, and workflow monitoring, they rely on the \textit{Infrastructure as a Service} (IaaS) model. While offering significant flexibility and control over the computing environment, \textit{IaaS} comes with notable drawbacks as mentioned previously. A major challenge of IaaS platforms is the complexity of \textit{managing and provisioning} virtual machines, storage, and network resources, which requires expertise and incurs significant overhead. Users must also handle scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance manually, often leading to inefficiencies. Predicting resource requirements is difficult, often resulting in \textit{over-} or \textit{under-provisioning}, and the typical hourly billing model can further increase costs, particularly for short workflows that run for only a few minutes.

As highlighted previously, the \textit{serverless} paradigm excels in scenarios where automatic scaling and cost-efficiency are essential, while also providing a much easier set-up process for developers by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure and only requiring the user to follow a few coding rules and minor configuration. Despite its current inefficiencies, the serverless model shows great potential for efficiently running the same types of data processing pipelines and workflows as those handled by the frameworks previously mentioned. Next, we will explore some of the most relevant solutions for scheduling serverless workflows.

\subsection{Modern Workflow Scheduling}

The limitations of IaaS-based frameworks, such as those mentioned previously, have led to a new generation of workflow orchestrators designed for flexibility, usability, and ease of deployment. Unlike earlier systems bound to static clusters and rigid DSLs, modern platforms embrace Python APIs, containerization~\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/containerization/}}, and cloud-native~\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cloud-native/}} principles. Tools such as Prefect~\cite{prefect}, Dagster~\cite{dagster}, and Airflow~\cite{apache_airflow} prioritize developer productivity and observability, while Argo Workflows~\cite{argo_workflows} leverages Kubernetes~\cite{kubernetes} as its native execution environment. Another interesting project is Apache Beam, a cloud-native \textit{unified programming model} for batch and streaming data pipelines designed to be executed across multiple backends, with some of the most popular implementations being Google Cloud Dataflow~\cite{google_dataflow}. These solutions mark a shift from infrastructure management toward higher-level abstractions that integrate seamlessly with cloud platforms and services.

\subsubsection{Stateful Serverless Functions}

While modern orchestrators such as Argo, Prefect, Dagster, and Airflow provide powerful abstractions for coordinating workflows across diverse environments, they can be unnecessarily complex for developers who already rely on stateless serverless functions within a single cloud provider. In such cases, what is often required is not a general-purpose orchestration framework but a lightweight mechanism to compose stateless functions into more complex workflows, supporting coordination patterns such as \textit{fan-out}, \textit{fan-in}, and conditional branching. To address this gap, cloud providers have introduced \textit{stateful serverless functions}, which augment the stateless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model with durable state management and execution control.

A \textbf{stateful serverless function} represents a workflow orchestration paradigm in which an external coordination layer manages the execution and state of multiple stateless function invocations. These orchestrators track workflow progress, preserve context across invocations, and handle retries, error propagation, and branching logic. A common mechanism across these platforms is the use of \textit{snapshotting} or durable state persistence: the engine periodically records workflow state so that execution can be paused and later resumed without requiring all individual functions to remain active. By combining snapshotting with techniques such as event sourcing, persistent queues, and transactional state management, stateful orchestrators enable long-running workflows that can scale across distributed environments while remaining fault tolerant and cost efficient.

Prominent examples include AWS Step Functions~\cite{aws_step_functions}, Google Cloud Workflows~\cite{google_cloud_workflows}, Azure Durable Functions~\cite{azure_durable_functions}, and Cloudflare Workflows~\cite{cloudflare_workflows}. Despite differences in design and integration, they share the goal of simplifying complex coordination atop serverless platforms. AWS Step Functions offers JSON- or YAML-based state machines using the Amazon States Language (ASL)\footnote{\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html}}, enabling workflows that may last up to one year. Google Cloud Workflows provides YAML- or JSON-based definitions with a maximum duration of 60 minutes per execution, tightly integrated with Google Cloud services such as BigQuery and Cloud Run. Azure Durable Functions follows a code-centric approach in which developers write an \textit{"orchestrator function"} in languages such as C\#, JavaScript, or Python, with workflow durations of up to 30 days. Finally, Cloudflare Workflows emphasizes lightweight, edge-native~\footnote{\url{https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/}} orchestration, optimized for event-driven scenarios at the edge.

Together, these services extend the applicability of serverless beyond short-lived, stateless tasks, enabling complex approval processes, data pipelines, machine learning training, and financial transaction workflows that require state persistence and long execution durations. At the same time, they shift the responsibility of orchestration away from developers, who would otherwise need to implement custom, serverful coordination layers. 

The tradeoff, however, is strong vendor lock-in, since each provider enforces its own workflow representation and tight integration with its ecosystem, making portability and hybrid-cloud adoption more challenging. Furthermore, the user is billed for the orchestration service on top of the individual function executions, which can increase costs for long-running or highly parallel workflows compared to managing orchestration independently. In addition, the orchestrator can make suboptimal scheduling decisions, such as inefficient task placement or resource allocation, over which the user has little or no control, potentially impacting performance and cost efficiency.

\subsection{Serverless Workflow Scheduling}
% mention that it is implemented by rewriting parts of Dask Distributed!!
Having discussed commercial stateful serverless functions and their advantages and limitations, we now turn to research-oriented approaches for orchestrating workflows in stateless serverless environments. Unlike managed offerings, some of these systems explore innovative scheduling strategies and trade-offs that are particularly relevant for our work.

Workflow scheduling/orchestration in serverless environments can generally be categorized into three approaches:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Centralized scheduling:} In this approach, a single scheduler maintains a global view of the entire workflow, including task dependencies, resource availability, and execution progress. This allows the scheduler to make fine-grained decisions about task placement, load balancing, and prioritization, often optimizing for latency or resource utilization. However, the centralized model can become a bottleneck as workflow size and concurrency increase, introducing single points of failure. It also requires the scheduler to handle high-throughput metadata and state management, which can be challenging in highly dynamic serverless environments.

\item \textbf{Queue-based or message-driven scheduling:} Here, tasks are decoupled from execution using queues or message-passing systems. Producers submit tasks to a queue, and workers pull tasks asynchronously when they become idle. This design improves elasticity, as workers can scale independently of the workflow controller, and naturally provides fault toleranceâ€”failed tasks can be retried by re-queuing. While it removes the single bottleneck of a centralized scheduler, queue-based systems may have less optimal global scheduling decisions, and additional logic may be needed to enforce task ordering or dependency constraints.

\item \textbf{Decentralized/Choreographed scheduling:} In this model, the responsibility for orchestration is distributed across the worker nodes rather than concentrated in a central entity. Each node independently manages task execution, coordinates with peers, and propagates state updates as necessary. This approach eliminates the need for dedicated scheduler infrastructure, mitigates bottlenecks, and enables faster scaling to thousands of concurrent functions. However, this model introduces greater complexity in ensuring fault tolerance and consistent state propagation across distributed, ephemeral environments. Ensuring that tasks execute \textit{exactly once} becomes particularly challenging, requiring stronger coordination and consensus mechanisms. To address these issues, techniques such as Paxos~\cite{paxos}, Raft~\cite{raft}, or coordination services like ZooKeeper~\cite{zookeeper} can be employed, along with localized snapshots or lightweight distributed state stores, to maintain workflow coherence and reliability without relying on centralized scheduling. Most existing solutions, however, assume that tasks are \textit{idempotent}, so that repeated execution does not produce unintended side effects, simplifying failure recovery and avoiding the need for strict exactly-once guarantees.



\subsubsection{DEWE v3}
DEWE v3~\cite{dewe_v3} introduces an innovative hybrid approach to serverless workflow orchestration that combines the best aspects of both serverless and serverful computing models. This hybrid workflow execution engine intelligently distributes tasks based on their characteristics: \textit{short tasks} are run on FaaS workers while \textit{longer tasks} run on virtual machines. The system employs a queue-based job distribution mechanism where jobs expected to complete within FaaS limits are published to a common job queue for serverless execution, while long-running jobs are directed to a separate queue for local, serverful execution on dedicated servers. Jobs that fail to execute on FaaS workers, for being longer than expected and exceeding execution limits imposed by the platform, are redirected to the serverful queue. This dual-execution model enables DEWE to accommodate workflows with diverse resource consumption patterns. This system proves particularly effective for scientific workflows, such as Montage~\cite{montage_astronomy}, where task durations and resource requirements vary significantly. However, this hybrid approach introduces specific trade-offs. Latency-sensitive workflows may be slowed by job queuing overhead. In addition, hybrid deployments often lead to resource underutilization, as serverful workers may sit idle when most tasks are executed on FaaS. Finally, the centralized workflow manager can become a scalability bottleneck when handling many short tasks.

\subsubsection{PyWren}
PyWren~\cite{pywren}, representing one of the pioneering pure serverless approaches, demonstrates the potential and limitations of leveraging unmodified serverless infrastructure for distributed computation. Built atop AWS Lambda, PyWren focuses on executing arbitrary Python functions as stateless serverless functions with minimal user management overhead, automatically handling function execution, dependencies, S3 bucket storage for serialized code and intermediate data. The system is ideal for embarrassingly parallel workloads, also known as \textit{"bag-of-tasks"} scenarios, with many independent, parallel tasks such as simple data transformations, scientific simulations, parallel model training, and large-scale media processing. While PyWrenâ€™s serverless orchestration model provides excellent scalability and removes the burden of infrastructure management, its simplicity limits its applicability. It is not well-suited for workflows with complex dependency structures or those that require sharing large intermediate results through object storage. Moreover, latency-sensitive applications are disadvantaged by function cold starts, since PyWren does not include mechanisms to mitigate their impact.

\subsubsection{Unum}
Unum~\cite{unum_decentralized_orchestrator} takes a radically different approach from the two previous solutions by decentralizing orchestration logic entirely, eliminating the need for a standalone orchestrator service. This application-level serverless workflow orchestration system embeds orchestration logic directly into a library that wraps user-defined FaaS functions, leveraging an external scalable consistent data store for coordination during fan-ins and execution correctness. Unum introduces an Intermediate Representation (IR) to capture information about workflow progression (nearby tasks) and relies only on minimal, common serverless APIs (function invocation and basic data store operations) available across cloud platforms. This design choice provides exceptional portability and cost-effectiveness, as it can run on unmodified serverless infrastructure. Unum also can and compile workflows defined in languages from providers like AWS Step Functions and Google Cloud Workflows into its IR format. However, Unum's generic approach comes with trade-offs: it currently supports only statically defined control structures and cannot express workflows where the next step is determined dynamically at runtime, and it lacks data locality optimizations since it cannot force related tasks to execute on the same worker, with each function instance executing only its specific task before triggering the next function.

\subsubsection{WUKONG}
WUKONG~\cite{wukong_2} represents the most sophisticated approach among these solutions, designed as a decentralized locality-enhanced serverless workflow engine. WUKONG addresses the limitations of traditional serverful models like Dask Distributed while maximizing the advantages of serverless computing, focusing on improving scale-out speed and enhancing data locality to minimize large object movement. The system's architecture is divided into static components (operating before workflow execution) and dynamic components (operating during execution). The static scheduler includes a \textbf{DAG Generator} that converts Python code into DAGs (using Dask), a \textbf{Schedule Generator} that creates \texttt{n} static schedules for \texttt{n} root/leaf nodes (each containing every reachable task in a depth-first search starting at that node), \textbf{Initial Task Executor Invokers} that launches the first Lambda instances for each root task, and a \textbf{Process} on the client that waits for and downloads final results. 

After receiving the initial schedules, FaaS workers (referenced to as \textit{AWS Lambda Executors}) drive workflow execution. Workers execute tasks until they encounter a \textit{fan-out}, at which point they transfer data to intermediate storage, execute 1 of the \texttt{N} fan-out tasks and invoke \textit{N - 1} \textit{new} executors for the other tasks. Then, when they find a \textit{fan-in}, the group of executors that reach the common fan-in node cooperate using a \textit{dynamic scheduling} model to select only one executor to proceed. This coordination is managed through a shared \textbf{dependency counter} in a Key-Value Store (KVS). Each involved executor \textit{atomically} updates this counter; the one whose update satisfies the final input dependency for the fan-in task will execute that task and continue along its static schedule. The other executors transfer their intermediate data to storage, and then stop their execution, decreasing the workflow parallelism.

Besides dynamic scheduling, WUKONG employs data locality optimization techniques designed to avoid moving large data objects; \textbf{Task Clustering for Fan-Out Operations} allows executors to continue executing downstream tasks when a fan-out task produces large outputs, becoming the executor of multiple fan-out targets rather than just executing 1 and invoking \texttt{N - 1} new executors; \textbf{Task Clustering for Fan-In Operations} enables executors to recheck dependencies after uploading large objects to storage, potentially executing fan-in tasks themselves if dependencies are satisfied during the upload process, potentially avoiding large downloads; \textbf{Delayed I/O} allows executors to hold off on writing large intermediate results to external storage until it is absolutely necessary. Instead of immediately storing data when some downstream tasks are not yet ready, the executor first runs any tasks that can proceed and then checks again if the remaining ones have become ready. If they have, the executor can execute them directly using the data already in memory, avoiding both the write and a later read from storage. Only when no further progress is possible are the results finally written out. This can reduce unnecessary data transfers.

These optimizations, combined with WUKONG's decentralized scheduling approach, significantly enhance performance compared to both \textbf{Dask Distributed} and \textbf{PyWren} by minimizing data transfer overhead and eliminating central scheduler bottlenecks. However, WUKONG shares the limitation of supporting only statically defined control structures, requiring workflow DAGs to be known ahead-of-time, similarly to our proposed solution. Additionally, its optimization heuristics can lead to inefficiencies in certain scenarios: \textit{Delayed I/O} may increase makespan and storage usage if dependencies aren't met after retries; fan-in conflicts where multiple tasks produce large objects can result in resource waste depending on upload timing; and fan-out scenarios with small inputs may not justify the overhead of invoking multiple executors as it can make subsequent fan-in's more expensive. Furthermore, WUKONG assumes a homogeneous execution environment, where all workers provide identical resources (e.g., each task is allocated 2 CPU cores and 512 MB of memory), which prevents tailoring resources to tasks with different computational or memory demands.

While WUKONG represents a significant advance in serverless workflow orchestration through its decentralization, its scheduling and optimizations remain limited. The system bases decisions only on the next stage of the workflow (i.e., one-to-one, fan-in, or fan-out transitions). We refer to this as \textit{one-step scheduling}, since it relies solely on information about the next step. Crucially, WUKONG does not exploit the global knowledge of the workflow structure, even though the entire workflow structure is known before execution begins. Also, its optimizations rely on heuristic-based strategies that can lead to suboptimal performance when workflow behavior deviates from expected patterns.
